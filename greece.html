        <p class="contentDescription">
            In a world of nothing, out of nowhere comes Chaos. From Chaos, Hesiod derives Gaia (the Earth), Eros (Sexuality), Tartarus (Underworld), Erebus (Darkness), and Nyx (Night) who reproduces with Erebus and gives birth to Day and Space. Gaia gives birth to Ouranos (Heaven), Ourea (Mountains), and Pontus (Sea). Ouranos reproduces with Gaia to create the twelve Titans, the Cyclops, and the Hundred Armed. <br/><br/>
            After Gaia gives birth to each child, Ouranos hides the children because he is afraid that the Gaia will ally with his children to overthrow him. In response, Gaia conspires with her son Kronos (Time) to punish him and castrate him. Aphrodite (Beauty, Love, Sexuality) is created from the castrated part.<br/><br/>
            Kronos ends up marrying his sister Rhea (Titan) has six children: Hestia (Home), Demeter (Harvest), Hades (Underworld), Zeus (Father of the Gods). In order to protect himself against his children, Kronos swallows all his children but Zeus. Gaia and Ouranos help Rhea trick Kronos into not only not swallowing Zeus, but also vomiting up the previously swallowed children.<br/><br/>
            Zeus marries Metis (Titan) and has children with her. He has the same fears as Ouranos and Kronos and subsequently swallows Metis. However, Metis had already been pregnant with Athena (Wisdom) and she continues to bring her up inside of Zeus until she comes out from Zeus’s forehead. Following this, Zeus marries different women until he settles for Hera. The children Zeus has with Hera don’t threaten him and he lets things go their natural way.<br /><br />
            After Prometheus steals fire from the gods to give to the people, Zeus creates Pandora, the first woman, to punish humans for stealing from the gods.
