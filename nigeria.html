        <h4 class="contentTitle">The Origin of Death</h4>
        <p class="contentDescription">In the beginning there is neither disease nor death. Everyone lived in a happy world. However, one day a man got sick and died so the people sent a worm to the sky to ask what they should do with the body. The worm started its journey. When he arrived, the sky told him to tell the people that they should hang the body in a fork and throw mush at it until it comes back to life. Doing this would eliminate death and disease for everyone. The worm started his journey back but was very slow. A mischievous lizard heard of this and ran ahead because he wanted to deceive the people. He told the people that he was sent because he was faster and that they were supposed to bury the body in the ground. When the worm returned the people asking him why he didnâ€™t return sooner and told him about the lizard. The worm informed the people that the sky had not sent the lizard and that the instructions were incorrect. But the people were too lazy to follow the instructions the worm had returned from the sky and this is the reason why people still die today.</p>
