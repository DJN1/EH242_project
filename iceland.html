        <p class="contentDescription">
            The first world to exist was Muspell in the southern hemisphere. Non-natives could not endure the flames and light of it, and it was guarded by Surt with a flaming sword. At the end of the world Surt will vanquish all the gods and burn the world. Outside of Muspell is Ginnungagap (Void), and beyond this is Niflheim. Niflheim is icy and in the northern hemisphere. The heat from Muspell and the ice from Niflheim met at Ginnungagap and formed the frost ogre Ymir from the thawed ice. Ymir slept and fell into a sweat and his sweat turned into man and woman.<br /><br />
            When the ice melted it turned into a cow called Audhumla and from its utter ran four milk rivers that fed Ymir. The cow fed on salt blocks. After licking for three days she freed a man named Buri from the salt block. Buri was tall, handsome and strong. Buri had a son named Bor who married the daughter of a giant named Bestla. Bor and Bestla had three sons: Odin, Vili and Ve. People believe that Odin with his brothers is the ruler of heaven and earth. Odin is known to be the greatest and most known of all men.<br /><br />
            Odin, Vili and Ve kill Ymir. When Ymir hit the ground, blood streamed from his wounds and all the frost ogres drowned except for Bergelmir who escaped with his wife by climbing into a hollow tree. The family of frost ogres stems from Bergelmir and his wife.<br /><br />
            The sons of Bor carried the body of Ymir to Ginnungagap and made the world from him. They made all the bodies of water from his blood and from his flesh they made the earth. They made the trees using his hair, the mountains using his bones, and the rocks and pebbles from his teeth.<br /><br />
            From Ymir’s flesh came maggots that took the shape of humans but lived in the earth and rocks. From Ymir’s skull Bor’s sons made the sky set it over the earth with its four sides. They put four dwarfs, East, West, North, and South under each of the four corners. Then they took the sparks and embers from Muspell after it had been blown out and put them in Ginnungagap as stars to provide light to heaven above and earth below. They flung Ymir’s brain up in the sky to create the clouds.<br /><br />
            The earth was surrounded by a deep sea and Bor’s sons gave land near the sea to the families of giants to settle. The sons then built an inland stronghold named Midgard to be protected from the giants.<br /><br />
            While walking at the seashore the sons of Bor created man and woman from two trees they found. Odin gave man and woman spirit and life, Vili gave them understanding and movement, and Ve gave them clothing and names. Ve named the man Ask and the woman Embla. Ask and Embla are the source of all that live in Midgard.<br /><br />
            The sons then built another stronghold in the middle of the world named Asgard, later called Troy. The gods lived in Asgard. There was a great hall named Hlidskjalf where Odin sat on a high seat and looked over the world.<br /><br />
            Odin married Frigg. Odin and all his family are called the Aesir and they live in Asgard. Odin also married his daughter the earth and had his first son, Thor, with her. Thor was strong and dominated every living creature.
