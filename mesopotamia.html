        <p class="contentDescription">
            Before the earth and the sky are named, Apsu (the “begetter”) and Tiamat (the “maker”) dwell together. Nothing exists yet. Apsu and Tiamat have children: Lahmu, Lahamu, Anshar, and Kishar. The Anshar has a son called Anu who in turn has children with Nudimmud (Ea). Each generation is superior to their parents.<br /><br />
            When the gods get together, they disturb Tiamat with their noise, and although Apsu tries to quite them down but fails and calls his vizier. Apsu tells Tiamat that he will destroy his children so he can get rest, but Tiamat gets angry at the idea of destroying their offspring. However, the vizier agrees with Apsu and encourages the idea. Ea finds out about the plan and casts a sleep spell on Apsu, undresses him and kills him. After killing Apsu, he lives where he killed Apsu and calls it Apsu. <br /><br />
            He lives there with his lover Damkina and they have a child, Marduk. He is born powerful and Apsu is so happy about this that he gives him god-like attributes. Anu creates the four winds and gives them to Marduk who stirs up Tiamat’s water. She is accused by some of being a bad mother. Her children tell her that she needs to create trouble for Ea and his fellow gods in return. Tiamat, being the maker, creates monsters and puts her consort Qingu in Apsu’s spot as leader of the army.<br /><br />
            Tiamat assembles here army of monsters and Ea hears about her plan and reports to his father Anshar to get help. But Anshar tells Ea that he is unbeatable, and he sends him to fight Tiamat. Ea goes but retreats and tells Anshar that he was too weak. When Anshar hears about this he upset and assembles with the rest of the gods. Ea encourages Marduk to talk to Anshar. Marduk does as told and upon meeting Anshar’s mood lightens. Marduk asks Anshar to send him to fight Tiamat and assures Anshar that he will defeat Tiamat.<br /><br />
            Anshar instructs his vizier to warn Lahmu and Lahamu about their mother and ask all the gods to attend a banquet to eat drink and “decree” Marduk.<br /><br />
            The gods build a shrine for Marduk and make him sovereign over everything. They challenge him to destroy and rebuilt a structure using only his words. He does and he is made king. After being made king, the gods give him weapons for his fight with Tiamat. He rides into battle on his storm-chariot and challenges Tiamat to one-on-one combat. Marduk captures Tiamat in his net and blows winds at her which she swallows. This causes Tiamat’s belly to balloon and he kills her by shooting an arrow at her stomach which splits her in half. Marduk then captures all the gods that fought with Tiamat and kills Qingu.<br /><br />
            Marduk sets up constellations for the gods and creates a year to be twelve months. The other gods give him presents and name him “King od the gods of heaven and earth”. Marduk creates man from Qingu’s blood. The gods get places in heaven assigned by Marduk and the gods start building shrines for themselves. The job of the humans is to worship the gods and take care of the shrines.
