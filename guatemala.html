        <p class="contentDescription">
            In the beginning everything was dark and only the sky existed in addition to the creator gods: Heart of Sky, Sovereign Serpent, Xpiyacoc, and Xmucane. They start out by creating the animals to worship the gods, but the animals are unable to do so.<br /><br />
            They try creating humans from mud, but they just crumble, fall apart, and dissolve in water.<br /><br />
            Next, they try creating humans carved from wood, but their bodies were deformed, they couldn’t worship and had no compassion. Heart of sky killed the humans with a great flood. Those who survived became monkeys.<br /><br />
            Seven Macaw, one of the gods magnifies himself by falsely claiming to be the sun. Hunahpu and Xbalanque decide that he must be defeated to discourage similar behavior by others. Similar to Seven Macaw, his two sons also falsely claim to be creator and destroyer of the earth. Hunahpu and Xbalanque kill Seven Macaw. Hurricane later instructs them to also kill Seven Macaw’s two sons.<br /><br />
            Hunahpu and Xbalanque were born after their fathers, One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu, make too much noise and are put to a test. Their fathers are given tools to make light and told not to use them up, but they do and so they are sacrificed. When the head of One Hunahpu is placed on a tree, a drop of his blood causes the tree to be fruitful. The head talks to Blood Moon, argues with her, spits in her hand and she becomes pregnant with Hunahpu and Xbalanque.<br /><br />
            After the previous unsuccessful tries at creating humans, the creator gods talk to Plumed Sovereign Serpent and figure out how they need to create the humans to be successful. They grind up white and yellow corn and create the first humans and wives for each of them. The humans start wandering around trying to find a place for them to settle.<br /><br />
            After they find a place, the sleep to wake up and find that the totems for their gods have turned to stone. They celebrate but the gods make the humans jealous of another tribe’s gods. The humans try to trick the other tribe, the Quiche, so they can steal the gods but fail so they try to attack them. However, the Quiche are strong. They defend themselves and the people who tried to attack either die or are condemned to paying tribute back to the Quiche for the rest of their lives. The first successfully created humans tell their sons to return where they received the gods and then die instead of paying tribute to the Quiche.
