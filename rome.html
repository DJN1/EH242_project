        <p class="contentDescription">
            Ovid starts his creation narrative by invoking the gods and asking for inspiration for his work. A god separates chaos (defined here as an “undigested mass of … scrambled elements”) into sky and earth, earth and waves, and thicker air from thinner air. He creates the earth, water, seas, and winds and gives each a region to control. Next, the god creates animals and places them in their respective habitat. He then creates gods and places them in the sky. Ovid then explains that man was either created by the god from a “divine seed” or that Prometheus sculpted man from earth mixed with rainwater.<br /><br />
            Ovid then explains the different ages starting with the Golden age. During this period, humans lived in harmony without armies, no exploration or conquest and no agriculture. Humans lived old but were not immortal and because they did not reproduce, the golden age came to an end.<br /><br />
            During the Silver age, Jove rules Rome. Season now exist and because of the temperature differences during the different seasons’ humans seek shelter in houses.<br /><br />
            Following the Silver age is the Bronze age. Humans start becoming cruel and start using weapons.<br /><br />
            The worst age is the Iron age. During this age “earth saw the flight of faith and modesty and truth” (Thury 43). Humans start exploring and exploiting earth for its natural resources. They also start farming and betraying one another and “the maid Astraea [Justice], last of the immortals, leaves the blood-soaked earth” (Thury 55).
