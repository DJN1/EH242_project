        <p class="contentDescription">
            Kintu was the first man and he found nothing in Uganda. He found no food but he had a cow with him and so he drank her milk when he became hungry. One day he saw two girls, Nambi and her sister, descend from heaven. They ask him about where he came from, what the cow is, what he eats, and what he drinks. Finally, they ask him if he is a man and asked him to come with them to heaven, but he said only if his cow could come too, which they declined. <br /><br />
            Nambi and her sister returned to heaven and informed their father, Mugulu, that they had found a man and a cow. Nambi asks him if she can bring him up to heaven, but her father tells her to leave it to him and then sends his son to get the cow. The sons take the cow when Kintu is asleep and when he wakes up and his cow is gone, he starts eating tree bark. The sisters come back down and ask him what he has been eating since his cow was taken and then invite him to come back to heaven with them to retrieve his cow from Mugulu.<br /><br />
            Upon arriving Mugulu tells Kintu that he can have his cow back once he eats a ten thousand dishes of food and drinks ten thousand measures of beer. If he finishes everything, he can have his cow back, if not is to be killed. Mugulu instructs his people to build a house for Kintu to eat in and then cook all the food for him. Kintu starts eating and notices a hole in his house and starts putting the food in the hole. Once he finished stuffing all the food in the hole, the people retrieve all the empty dishes and Mugulu informs Kintu that in order to get his cow back he will be given another challenge. He is given a copper axe and instructed to create a fire that burns stone. The axe tells him to strike the stone with it. He returns the splintered stone to Mugulu. Mugulu gives Kintu another challenge: to fill a bucket full of dew. Kintu returns to earth with the bucket and the bucket fills itself with dew, which Kintu returns to Mugulu. Mugulu gives Kintu one last challenge and tells him that if he solves the challenge, he can have back his cow and take Nambi back to earth. Kintu is challenged to pick his cow from ten thousand cows. A hornet helps him pick Kintu cow and he returns to earth with Nambi. <br /><br />
            Before he leaves, he is told that he cannot return for any as Nambi’s brother, Warumbe (Death), would join them. However, he forgets the millet for his cow and returns against Nambi advice. Upon returning, Warumbe insists on joining Nambi and Kintu. <br /><br />
            As time goes on, Nambi gets pregnant with Kintu and Warumbe asks if he can have the child. Kintu says that he can have the next one. This happens many times and one day Warumbe gets too upset and Warumbe starts killing Kintu’s children, each day killing more. Kintu asks Mugulu for help and he sends down his son Kaikuzi to bring back Warumbe to Mugulu. Warumbe refuses to go with Kaikuzi, and they grapple. But Kaikuzi gets tired, rests and issues a orders that there is two days of silence to bait Warumbe out, but this fails, and Kintu tells Kaikuzi that he can return, and Warumbe remained.
