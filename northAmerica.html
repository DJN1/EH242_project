        <h4 class="contentTitle">The Zuni Emergence Myth</h4>
        <p class="contentDescription">The people started in the fourth world. The world was dark and filthy, and the people urinated and spat on one another. After four days the sun took pity upon them and created two boys when its rays hit the mist in the first world. On the fourth day the boys found the entrance to the fourth world. They went through and came to the second world which only had little light. The boys kept going and came to the even darker third world. The two boys went through the entrance again and reached the black fourth world. Although the people in the fourth world couldn’t see the boys, they sensed the presence of the boys. <br /><br />
            In order to get the people to the daylight world, the younger brother went north and planted a pine, he turned around and the tree had grown. He tore off a branch and brought it to the people. He then repeated the same process with a spruce in the west, silver spruce in the south and an aspen tree in the east. The bow priests took the prayer stick made from the branch of pine, stuck it in the earth and the people climbed up it into the third world.<br /><br />
            The people stayed in the third world for four days and then the bow priests took the prayer stick made from spruce, stuck it into the earth and the people climbed up it into the second world.<br /><br />
            Again, the people stayed in the second world for four days before the priests took the silver spruce prayer stick, stuck it into the earth and climbed up it into the first world.<br /><br />
            The people stayed in the first world for four days and then bow priests stuck the aspen prayer stick into the ground and climbed up it into the daylight world.<br /><br />
            When the people arrived in the daylight world, the younger brother told the people to look at the sun. After four days the bow priests decided that the people should learn to eat and so they took some corn and planted it. Once it had grown, the men took it home to their wives, however, the people didn’t have mouths, so the brothers decided to carve a mouth into the humans. The priests cut the mouths when the people went to sleep using a ceremonial stone. However, the boys and the priests realized that the people could now eat, but not defecate so they carved anuses into the people. Again, a couple of days pass and the boys realized that the people still had webbed hands and feet, so they cut the webbing away. They also removed the horns and nails. After this the boys were done creating the humans.<br /><br />
            The humans split up into groups and divided up: one group goes north, one south, one east and one west.
